Octree generator for sibenik.bin to 3do format

I need convert sibenik.bin to 3do format for testing.

I develop the octree generator in :r4 but I need 64bits for morton code, then I traslate to C the 3do encoder and convert the voxels.

The sibenik file is in
https://www.dropbox.com/s/zdy53f7ywfs3mls/sibenik.7z

the file size in bin format is 700mb aprox with colors in 24bits

the 3do result is 400mb aprox in 32bits color.
